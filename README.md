<h2>Introduction:</h2><br/>
My name is Tomas Roy and I have over 10 years of experience in software engineering. During my previous experience I worked in several industries like software, oil & energy, Human resource industires.  Also handled various  kinds of clients. I  have team leading and management experience.  My main responsibilities are feasibility analysis, design , development , deployment & writing unit tests.

 Currently I am working in the large-scale distributed system of  Japan's largest e-commerce platform in a very diverse team. Here I am designing & implementing the REST API and integrating external micro-services. I am responsible to make the services more  scalable, fault tolerant. I do introduce new technologies if my team needs it.

I would like to add one more thing that i am a music lover, i play guitar to refresh myself. I used to travel in the mountains and sea to escape from a monotonous life which helps to boost & reload me for a new start.


<h2>Short Story of my career:</h2><br/>
First and foremost, I am a computer lover and love to write code for building a better world. I remember in my university days , I was scared to sit before the computer screen and barely write code. But my first job changed me a lot. My thought process , behavioural pattern changed a lot which helps me to drive me where i am right now. After then i worked in different companies with different background. Mostly my working domain is Software development, E-commerce, Oil & Energy, Recruitment &Translation services.

In this journey, I dealt with different client to make their production ready application. Most of the time i involved in full SDLC lifecycle. During my past experience even now, i never gave up myself to achieve product and company goal. Most recently i am working in migrating a big portion of a service from monolithic architecture to micro-service. I am using a message queue platform to bring the data from old to new system using Data capturing pipeline tools, creating separate consumer and micro-service to represent in GUI which will be highly scalable and fault tolerant.

Moreover, i always pursue myself to learn new cutting-edge technology both for frontend and backend.
Try to do everything in action. Currently, I am working on CI/CD tools for deploying the application using GIT, Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins pipeline which is running in a dedicated server. But i successfully shifted of my new project in cloud recently which helps my company to achieve their migration goal and save the 15% of maintenance cost.

In conclusion, I love to work in a collaborative team. As i had experience leading team of 5 members, i know how to value others. Only friendly environment and discussing culture can achieve the goal as team. I want to grow as a team which is very important to live our life.
